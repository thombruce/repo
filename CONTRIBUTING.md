# Guide to Contributing

## Introduction

Thank you for considering contributing to Helvellyn. Right now, I really want to know what you want from a CMS. If you'd really like to see a feature added to Helvellyn, please jump straight to [How to Suggest a Feature or Enhancement](#How-to-Suggest-a-Feature-or-Enhancement).

## Ground Rules

- Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
- Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Your First Contribution

There are currently no beginner issues; there are currently no issues at all. ☹️ In the meantime, feel free to get a feel for Helvellyn, suggest features and report any bugs you find.

## Getting Started

To make a code contribution:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. Submit a pull request to have your changes considered for merging into the master branch


## How to Report a Bug
Please submit an issue by completing the [Bug Report Template](https://github.com/thombruce/helvellyn.js/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).

## How to Suggest a Feature or Enhancement

Please submit an issue by completing the [Feature Request Template](https://github.com/thombruce/helvellyn.js/issues/new?template=feature_request.md).

## Code Review Process

Thom (that's me) will review your Pull Request. I should be able to look at these pretty regularly for the time being. If it looks like a useful or necessary contribution, we'll discuss your code and progress towards getting it merged.

Features and bug fixes will be tested in a production environment before being merged.

## Community

I'd like to be able to mention chat apps here... Perhaps I'll set up a Discord? Watch this space.

## Attribution

Totally a work in progress based on [nayafia/contributing-template](https://github.com/nayafia/contributing-template/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING-template.md).
